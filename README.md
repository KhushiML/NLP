# Project 1: Language Detection with Machine Learning

## Description :

Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document. The most important part of training a language detection model is data. The more data you have about every language, the more accurate your model will perform in real-time. 

## Dataset

The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages.
