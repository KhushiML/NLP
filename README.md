# Project 1: Language Detection with Machine Learning

Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document. The most important part of training a language detection model is data. The more data you have about every language, the more accurate your model will perform in real-time. 

### Dataset

The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages.

# Project 2: Real-Time Sentiment Analysis

The main purpose of sentiment analysis is to analyze the opinions of users of a particular product or service, which helps customers understand the quality of the product. For example, every time Apple releases a new iPhone, we see a lot of people giving their opinion on it, some like it and some criticize it, in the end, all peopleâ€™s opinions help us decide whether we should buy the new iPhone or not.

# Project 3: Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

Fake news is one of the biggest problems with online social media and even some news sites. Most of the time, we see a lot of fake news about politics. So using machine learning for fake news detection is a very challenging task.

### Dataset
The Kaggle dataset, I am using here for the fake news detection task has data about the news title, news content, and a column known as label that shows whether the news is fake or real.
